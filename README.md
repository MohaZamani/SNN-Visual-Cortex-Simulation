</p>

This project focuses on simulating image processing mechanisms inspired by the **primary visual cortex (V1)** and investigating **interlayer communication** in **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**. The project implements filters like **Difference of Gaussians (DoG)** and **Gabor filters** to simulate the functionality of V1 neurons, and uses neural coding schemes such as **Time to First Spike (TTFS)** and **Poisson coding**. The **Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)** learning rule is applied to enhance the learning process in SNNs.

## Project Overview
This project aims to simulate the functionality of visual cortex neurons through the application of **DoG** and **Gabor filters** on grayscale images, mimicking edge detection processes in biological vision systems. Furthermore, the project explores the encoding of visual information using **TTFS** and **Poisson coding**, and analyzes the performance of **spiking neural networks** with interlayer communication using the **STDP learning rule**.

## Implemented Features
1. **DoG Filter**:
   - Simulates on-center off-surround and off-center on-surround retinal receptive fields for edge detection.

2. **Gabor Filter**:
   - Simulates simple cells in the primary visual cortex (V1), detecting edges at specific orientations and spatial frequencies.

3. **Neural Coding**:
   - **Time to First Spike (TTFS)**: Encodes images based on the timing of neuron spikes.
   - **Poisson Coding**: Encodes images using Poisson-distributed spike times.

4. **Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)**:
   - STDP learning rule adjusts synaptic weights based on spike timing to optimize the SNNâ€™s performance in recognizing visual patterns.
